# The year of 2013 is the first year after the old 1987 with only distinct digits.

# Now your task is to solve the following problem: given a year number, find the minimum year number which is strictly larger than the given one and has only distinct digits.

# Input/Output
# [input] integer year

# 1000 â‰¤ year â‰¤ 9000

# [output] an integer

# the minimum year number that is strictly larger than the input number year and all it's digits are distinct.

def distinct_digit_year(year)
  year += 1
  year += 1 until year.digits.uniq == year.digits
  year
end

def distinct_digit_year(year)
  year += 1 until year.next.digits.uniq.size == 4
  return year + 1
end
